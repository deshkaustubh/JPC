/*
In Android Studio, the main activity is the entry point for your Android application. It's the first screen users see when they launch the app. The MainActivity class extends AppCompatActivity or Activity and serves as the backbone of your appâ€™s user interface and logic.

Key Aspects of the Main Activity:
- Lifecycle Management: The MainActivity goes through different states (onCreate(), onStart(), onResume(), onPause(), etc.), which you can override to control how your app behaves when launched, minimized, or closed.
- UI Components: It is typically associated with an XML layout file (activity_main.xml), where you define buttons, text views, and other UI elements.
- Event Handling: You write Java or Kotlin code in MainActivity.java or MainActivity.kt to handle user interactions, such as button clicks.
- Navigation: It often acts as a hub for navigating to other activities or fragments in the app
